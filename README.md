# DeepBermuda

DeepBermuda is a neural network-enhanced implementation of the Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo (LSM) method for pricing Bermudan options, with a focus on high-dimensional, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. This project extends traditional LSM by replacing polynomial regression with a feedforward neural network to more accurately estimate continuation values in complex multi-asset settings. It is specifically designed to handle basket-style Bermudan options with many underlyings, reflecting real-world OTC structures where early exercise occurs at discrete intervals. The goal is to explore the intersection of deep learning and advanced option pricing for flexible, high-dimensional derivatives.

## Configurable Parameters

You can customize the simulation by editing the following variables in `main.py`:

Note: These settings are for American Options

- `num_of_paths`: Number of simulated paths (e.g. 100)
- `num_of_steps`: Number of time steps per path (e.g. 365 for daily)
- `time_to_exp`: Time to expiration (in years)
- `init_stock_price`: Initial stock price
- `drift`: Expected return (assumed to be equal to the risk-free rate under risk-neutral measure)
- `risk_free_interest`: Risk-free interest rate
- `volatility`: Annualized volatility of the stock
- `strike_price`: Strike price of the option
- `poly_degree`: Degree of polynomial regression used in the LSM algorithm
- `option_type`: Set the option type â€” use `OptionType.CALL` for a call option or `OptionType.PUT` for a put option
